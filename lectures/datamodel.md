## Database Design

### Data and Relational Modeling
(a.k.a. data structure)
----

##### Definitions (alphebetical):

1. __Attributes__: columns of a table 
1. __Data model__: is a description of data (information/situation/etc.) that includes the structure (attributes), the operations (queries/modifications), and constraints (field types)
1. __Domain__: Each component of the tuple is atomic data type (integer, string)
2. __Record__: (a.k.a. *row*) of a relation (table)
1. __Relation__: is a table; a set of tuples, not ordered list (see tuple below).  Relations change over time (tables get updated)
1. __Relational Model__: describes data using relations (i.e., tables)
1. __Schemas__: Name and attributes of a relation.  For example, `Course(title, room, time, instructor)`
1. __Tuples__: rows of a relation.  Tuples have one component for each attribute.

##### Key Constraints
Keys play an important part in relational models (thus database design). Keys are one or more attribute in a relation used to identify a record.  Keys ideally are unique, however, it is possible to have a nonunique key.   

A key containing two or more attributes is referred to as a __composite key__.  __Candidate keys__ are one or more attributes that uniquely identify each row in a relation.  Primary key(s) is/are the selected candidate key(s) to use.  In the `Products` table, `product_id` was the primary key.  Note `UPC` was a candidate key.

__Surrogate key__ is a column made by an arbitrary assignment of a key to a row.  Mostly, a surrogate key is an auto-incremented integer that has no connection to the data and is void of meaning.  For example, you could use `UPC` as a primary key since it is unique to each product and each product has (or should have) a UPC.  (Another example is a social security number of individuals).  However, it is possible for the UPC to change or become obsolete.  A generic (surrogate) key is a better choice.  Google 'is it better to use a surrogate key'.
